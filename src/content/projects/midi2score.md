## What it is

MIDI2Score explores whether symbolic music transcription can be framed as a sequence-to-sequence problem, with MIDI token sequences as input and MusicXML token sequences as output.

## Problem

Turning raw symbolic music data into readable score structure is not just a formatting task. It requires a representation that can preserve musical intent while staying learnable for a sequence model.

## Approach

The project uses a Transformer-based setup and treats the conversion problem as token-to-token translation. That keeps the framing close to modern sequence modeling workflows while staying focused on symbolic music rather than audio.

## Why it matters

Even in its early state, the project is a useful experiment at the intersection of generative modeling, structured outputs, and music representation.
